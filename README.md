# Frostpunk-Redesign

## [Tutorial repo for how to create the parallax header](https://github.com/ethandpark/frostpunk-tutorial)

This was created, in part, to be a redesign of the website: https://www.frostpunkgame.com/. However, the main goal of this project was to practice creating parallax headers Javascript, as well as a few other simple JS animations.

The site is rather slow to load, and that is due to the original image files being very large. I might fix this issue at a later point, but my main goal was to use Photoshop to cut a digital painting into multiple layers and turn them into a parallax heading, which I feel has been accomplished.

#### All imagery is sourced straight from the original website content belongs solely to 11bit Studios.
