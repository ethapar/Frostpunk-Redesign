# Frostpunk-Redesign
This was created, in part, to be a redesign of https://www.frostpunkgame.com/. However, the main goal of this was to practice creating parallax headers and other simple JS animations.

All imagery is sourced straight from the original website content belongs solely to 11bit Studios.

The site is rather slow to load, and that is due to the original image files being very large. I might fix this issue at a later point, but my main goal was to use Photoshop to cut a digital painting into multiple layers and turn them into a parallax heading, which I feel has been accomplished.
